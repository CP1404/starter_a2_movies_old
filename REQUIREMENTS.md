# CP1404 Assignment 2: Movies to Watch 2.0 Requirements

## Note: 
This document is only meant to be a helpful reference for the assignment requirements stored right here with your code.  
The PDF provided contains the complete details.   
Any discrepancy is accidental - and the PDF is the correct and complete version of the assignment requirements.  


## Task:

Create both a console program and a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
program similar to your first assignment, using Python 3 and the Kivy
toolkit, as described in the following information and accompanying
screencast video. This assignment will help you build skills using
**classes** and **GUIs** as well as giving you more practice using
techniques like selection, repetition, exceptions, lists, file I/O and
functions.  
***Everything*** you need to
complete this assignment can be found in the subject materials.

## Classes:

The most important learning outcome of this assignment is to be able to
use **classes** to create reusable data types that simplify and
modularise your programs. The fact that you can use these classes in
both console and GUI programs highlights this modularity.

It is important that you ***create these classes first** - before any
code that requires them. This is good coding practice. You should
write and then test each method of each class - **one at a time -
committing as you go** (e.g. you might commit each time you complete a
method and its tests).

We will assess your Git commit history to see (and mark) that you do
these in an appropriate order, so make sure you write your classes, with
tests, then the console program, *before* attempting any functionality
for the GUI.

The starter code includes two files:  

- [test_movie.py](test_movie.py)
- [test_moviecollection.py](test_moviecollection.py)  

with incomplete code for testing your classes.
**Complete** these files with simple tests, that you write as you
develop your Movie and MovieCollection classes.

**Do not change the existing tests...**  
write code that makes these tests pass.

You may use `assert` as shown in lectures (testing, chapter 15), or just very
simple tests that print the results of calling the methods you are
testing with expected and actual results (as in [practical 06](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals/tree/master/prac_06#testing)).

Once you have written and tested your classes, you can then use the
Movie class in your console program.

### Movie
Complete the **Movie** class in [movie.py](movie.py). This should be a simple
class with the required attributes for a movie and the standard
methods: 

- `__init__` (constructor),
 
- `__str__` (used when
displaying movie details in the status message), and:

-   two (not one) methods, to mark the movie as watched or
    unwatched.

### MovieCollection
Complete the **MovieCollection** class in [moviecollection.py](moviecollection.py). It
should contain a *single* attribute: a list of Movie objects, and at
least the following methods:

-   the standard constructor and str methods
-   add movie - add a single Movie object to the movies attribute
-   get number of unwatched movies
-   get number of watched movies
-   load movies (from csv file into Movie objects in the list)
-   save movies (from movie list into csv file)
-   sort (by the key passed in, then by title) 
    (see `attrgetter` from the lecture on Classes)

    Notice that you do not store additional attributes like the
    number of movies, because this information is easily derived
    from what you do store (just the movies) (see [Data Storage pattern/principle](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns#data-storage))

## Console Program:

***After*** you have written and tested your classes, rewrite your first
assignment to make use of your new Movie class. Optionally, you may also
use the MovieCollection class in your console program.  
Start by copying
the code from your first assignment into the existing [a1_classes.py](a1_classes.py)
file and committing that. In the first assignment, each movie was stored
as a list. Modify your code so that each movie is stored as an object of
your new Movie class.

You do *not* need to rewrite your first assignment in any other way,
even if it had problems.  
We will only evaluate how you use the Movie class in the console
program.

## General Coding Requirements:

-   At the very top of your main.py file, complete the comment
    containing your details.
    
-   Document all of your classes and methods clearly with docstrings.
    Include inline/block comments as appropriate. You do not need
    comments in the kv file.

-   Make use of named constants where appropriate. E.g. colours could be
    constants.

-   Use functions/methods appropriately for each significant part of the
    program. Remember that functions should follow the Single
    Responsibility Principle.

-   Use exception handling where appropriate to deal with input errors.
    When error checking inside functions (e.g. a handler for clicking
    the Add button), you should consider the 
    [Function with error checking pattern](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns#function-with-error-checking).

-   Complete your GUI design using the kv language in the [app.kv](app.kv) file.
    Creating the movie buttons should be done in main.py, not in the kv
    file, since this will be dynamic. See [dynamic_widgets](https://github.com/CP1404/KivyDemos/blob/master/dynamic_widgets.py) (py and kv)

**GUI Program details, marking guide, etc. are all in the assignment PDF.  
Save a copy and keep it with you when you're working.**

## Project Reflection: 

It is important and beneficial for you to start developing good coding
and working practices, so you will complete a short but thoughtful
reflection on this project.  
Complete the template provided in the [README.md](README.md)
and reflect on what you learned regarding both coding and your
development process.  
**This is worth significant marks, so allocate significant time to it.**\
We expect answers that show some **detail** and **thought**, not just
trivial statements.
